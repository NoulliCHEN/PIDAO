Due to the file limit of Github, the training data can be found below:

  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z1uxG9R8AdAGJprG5STcphysjm56_0Jf/view?usp=drive_link

First download the data set (Darcy_421) by following the link above into a folder and rename the data folder to 'datasets_FNO'.

Run the 'fourier_2d_PIDAO.py' file to get the data of the training process.

```shell
python fourier_2d_PIDAO.py
```

It takes about 20 mins to train the neural network on the NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. The expected output includes training/test loss and accuracy.
